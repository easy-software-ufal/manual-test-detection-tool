<strong>Audio Check </strong>
Before you begin, make sure you are booted into a fresh session, and that you haven't opened any audio applications - including any browser pages with audio content.
<dl>
    <dt>Open Studio Controls from the menu</dt>
        <dd>Start Jack and confirm it runs properly (DSP shows a percentage). Then stop jack to confirm it closes properly (DSP shows 0%). Finish by starting Jack and keeping it on for the duration of this test.</dd>
        <dd>Start Carla and keep it around for your Patchbay.
    <dt>Open Hydrogen from the menu</dt>
        <dd>Create a quick beat and play it - you should hear sound. If you aren't hearing any sound, make sure that connections are accurate in <strong>Carla -> Patchbay</strong>, and that your hardware levels are not muted.</dd>
        <dd>See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/ProAudioIntro for more info on audio on Ubuntu Studio if you're having trouble. </dd>
        <dd>You can close Hydrogen once you are done</dd>
    <dt>Make sure pulseaudio is connected to jack</dt>
        <dd>In <strong>Carla -> Patchbay</strong> make sure that PulseIn and PulseOut exist and are connected to system input/output.</dd>
    <dt>Test desktop sound through jack</dt>
        <dd>Open firefox and go to any page that has audio. Flash video will not work, so html5 is preferred - such as http://youtube.com/html5. </dd>
