This testcase is to be carried out on an IBM z/VM guest (virtual machine). (Notice that the minimal architectural requirement is z13/z13s, starting with Ubuntu Server 20.04, otherwise zEC12/zBC12.)
Scope of this testcase is to verify that an Ubuntu Server live image can be installed on an IBM z/VM guest with the help of a 3270 terminal emulator.

<em>Proceed in your native language if you wish. Instructions will remain in English.</em>

Ensure the basic network configuration was not specified in the parmfile (1)
Ensure the boot-up of the installation system is complete (2)
<dl>
    <dt>Download the live server ISO image to your install server</dt>
	<dt>loopback</dt>
	<dt>-mount (</dt>
	<dt>better extract) it there</dt>
	<dt>make it remotely available via ftp.</dt>
    <dt>Connect the z/VM guest that is going to be installed with the help of a 3270 terminal emulator (usually x3270 or c3270).</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt>Transfer the kernel, initrd, parmfile and REXX script, located in the boot folder of the ISO image, to the z/VM guest (either with ftp or with the help of the 3270 terminal emulator file transfer functionality.</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt>Boot up a live server image by executing the ubuntu REXX script from CMS running inside of the z/VM guest.</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt>the installer will interactively ask about it. (1)</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
        
	<dt>Start the interactive questionnaire about the basic network configuration and make sure the URL to image (that needs to be specified in addition) is accessible (hence, ideally point to the image located on the install server.)</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt>use a remote ssh installer session to connect to the live installer. (2)</dt>
        <dd>A temporary installation password can be found at the end of the (3270) console boot log, like:</dd>
        <dd>|37.487176| cloud-initÂ¬1873|: installer:BpAGSH2HAMY5testcbvZ</dd>
    <dt>The subiquity UI will be displayed after login - choose your desired language,</dt>
	<dt>confirm the default 'English'.</dt>
    <dt>At the 'Zdev setup' screen select a DASD device.</dt>
        <dd>Alternatively zFCP/SCSI disk storage can be selected - if available.</dd>
        <dd>Overall it's recommended that DASD, as well as zFCP/SCSI disk storage, is tested. Hence if a second z/VM installation is done, it's recommended to use zFCP/SCSI instead of DASD disk storage that time. Usually two zfcp-host devices need to be selected and enabled. Then all available (usually four) paths must be automatically detected (multipath).</dd>
    <dt>At the network configuration screen, select 'Done' (it should be pre-selected).</dt>

    <dt>At the filesystem setup screen, select</dt>

    <dt>Fill out the user information dialog, ideally including the import of your SSH keys from launchpad (or github).</dt>

    <dt>Wait until the installation is complete</dt>
	<dt>select 'Reboot'.</dt>
