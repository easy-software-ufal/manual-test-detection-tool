This testcase is to be carried out on an IBM Z logical partition (LPAR). (Notice that the minimal architectural requirement is z13/z13s, starting with Ubuntu Server 20.04, otherwise zEC12/zBC12.)
Scope of this testcase is to verify that an Ubuntu Server live image can be installed on LPAR with the help of the HMC.

<em>Proceed in your native language if you wish. Instructions will remain in English.</em>

Ensure the basic network configuration was not specified in the parmfile (1)
Ensure the boot-up of the installation system is complete (2)
<dl>
    <dt>Download the live server ISO image to your install server</dt>
	<dt>loopback</dt>
	<dt>-mount (</dt>
	<dt>better extract) it there</dt>
	<dt>make it remotely available via ftp.</dt>
    <dt>Boot up a live server image with the help of the</dt>
	<dt>'Load from Removable Media and Server' task of the HMC (Hardware Management Console).</dt>
    <dt>the installer will interactively ask about it. (1)</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
        
	<dt>Start the interactive questionnaire about the basic network configuration and make sure that the URL to image, that needs to be specified too, is accessible (hence, ideally point to the image located on the install server).</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt>open the "Integrated ASCII Console" or use a remote ssh installer session (recommended) to connect to the live installer. (2)</dt>
        <dd>A temporary installation password can be found at the end of the ('Operating System Messages') console boot log, like:</dd>
        <dd>|37.487176| cloud-initÂ¬1873|: installer:BpAGSH2HAMY5testcbvZ</dd>
    <dt>The subiquity UI will be displayed after login - choose your desired language,</dt>
	<dt>confirm the default 'English'.</dt>
    <dt>At the 'Zdev setup' screen select zfcp-host devices (usually two)</dt>
	<dt>enable them</dt>
	<dt>(make sure the correct devices for your particular LPAR are used.</dt>
        <dd>Now all available (usually four) paths must be automatically detected (multipath).</dd>
        <dd>Alternatively DASD disk storage can be selected - if available.</dd>
        <dd>Overall it's recommended that zFCP/SCSI, as well as DASD disk storage, is tested. Hence if a second LPAR installation is done, it's recommended to use DASD instead of zFCP/SCSI disk storage that time.</dd>
    <dt>At the network configuration screen, select 'Done' (it should be pre-selected).</dt>

		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt>Wait until the installation is complete</dt>
	<dt>select 'Reboot'.</dt>
    <dt>You may optionally monitor the (re-)boot progress via the console ('Operating System Messages' HMC task).</dt>
