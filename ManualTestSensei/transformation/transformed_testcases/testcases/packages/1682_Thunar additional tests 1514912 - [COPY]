This testcase is intended to test for issues surrounding one specific bug.

For this test - Thunar crashes on moving/copying/renaming files.

<strong>This test might take some time to complete - please ensure you have enough time to allow Thunar to crash as we are trying to <em>force</em> a crash.</strong>

This test will check for issues with renaming files.
Ensure ame this file a few times - has Thunar crashed? If not continue renaming this file until you see the cras (1)
<dl>
    <dt>Open Thunar</dt>
	<dt>create folder A - the location is completely up to you</dt>
    <dt>Create a new file inside the folder - the name is completely up to you</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt>ename this file a few times - has Thunar crashed? If not continue renaming this file until you see the crash (1)</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
        
	<dt>Close and ignore the Apport window</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt>Restart Thunar.</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt> Continue renaming your file until Thunar crashes once more</dt>

    Things to note in your tracker report comment box:
    1 - has the time it takes for Thunar to crash - following an initial crash - changed? 
    2 - was the file name changed before Thunar crashed?
    3 - had the file name changed when you restarted Thunar? (assuming it hadn't before the crash)

    This test will check for issues with moving files amongst folders

    Ensure Thunar crashes (2)
<dl>
        <dt>Open Thunar and inside your previously created folder A</dt>
	<dt>- create a new one B</dt>
        <dt>Create enough files inside folder A to allow for moving some, without leaving folder A empty</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
        <dt>Move some of your files from A to B</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
        <dt>Move them back to A</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
        <dt>Continue moving files back and forth between folder A and B</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
        <dt> again ignore the Apport warning and restart Thunar (2)</dt>
        <dt>Continue moving some of the files back and forth between folder A and B until Thunar crashes</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    </dl>
[False Condition] 
<dl>
        <dt>Open Thunar and inside your previously created folder A - create a new one B</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
        <dt>Create enough files inside folder A to allow for moving some, without leaving folder A empty</dt>
        <dt>Move some of your files from A to B</dt>
        <dt>Move them back to A</dt>
        <dt>Continue moving files back and forth between folder A and B</dt>
    </dl>

[False Condition] 
<dl>
    <dt>Open Thunar and create folder A - the location is completely up to you</dt>
		<dd>[FILL VERIFICATION]</dd>
    <dt>Create a new file inside the folder - the name is completely up to you</dt>
</dl>


    This test will check for issues with moving files amongst folders - in seperate Thunar instances

    <dl>
        <dt>Open Thunar at  folder A - open a new Thunar at folder B</dt>
        <dt>Move some of your files from A to B</dt>
        <dt>Move them back to A</dt>
        <dt>Continue moving files back and forth between folder A and B</dt>
        <dt> When Thunar crashes, again ignore the Apport warning and restart Thunar</dt>
        <dt>Continue moving some of the files back and forth between folder A and B until Thunar crashes</dt>
    </dl>

    Things to note in your tracker report comment box:
    1 - has the time it takes for Thunar to crash - following an initial crash - changed? 
    2 - were the files moved before Thunar crashed?
