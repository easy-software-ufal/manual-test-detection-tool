    <dt>Are there any graphical display issues after login to a desktop environment?</dt>
    <dt>Where applicable, are you able to suspend and resume your system without issue?</dt>
    <dt>Do desktop effects (opening the dash, pressing alt+tab, using the super key and shortcuts) still function properly on your system? Is the performance similar or better with no graphical display issues?</dt>
    <dt>Does fast user switching work quickly and without any instability or display issues?</dt>
    <dt>Execute <em>glxinfo|grep renderer</em>. Does the renderer listed match your expectations for the machine (ie, if no discrete card, a software renderer, else the card should be listed)?</dt>
    <dt>Overall, does everything function the same or better than the stable version?</dt>
