# Ubuntu Manual Test Smell Analysis
This repository contains the manual testcases utilized by the quality team for testing ubuntu (and its flavors) packages and images, as well as manual tests for hardware compatibility. 

Also, this is a fork of [Ubuntu Manual Tests](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-manual-tests) that has been analyzed in search of test smells. These smells are based on Hauptmann et al. and on the [Open Test Smells Catalog](https://easy-software-ufal.github.io/testsmells/index.html).
