This test checks that Qjackctl can be set up.

<strong>Setting up Jack for low latency monitoring can take some experimentation, and can place a strain on the CPU and cause xruns (clicks and pops) when recording. When unsure of the capabilities of your computer, choose conservative settings for these tests.
</strong>

<dl>
    <dt>Click on the Setup button</dt>
        <dd>The "Setup - JACK Audio Connection Kit" window opens</dd>
    <dt>In the Settings tab, make sure the Realtime option is ticked</dt>
    <dt>Select the appropriate audio driver (if you have a firewire audio device , choose firewire. Otherwise leave it set to ALSA)</dt>
    <dt>Select the appropriate audio interface from interface dropdown menu</dt>
    <dt>Select the appropriate Sample Rate from the dropdown menu. For example, use 44,100 Hz for CD quality, or 48,000 if recommended for the audio card being used. A higher sample rate will give lower latency, but push the CPU harder & possibly cause xruns.</dt>
    <dt>Select a suitable Frames/Period from interface dropdown menu. For low latency monitoring choose somewhere between 64-256. If unsure, be conservative and leave the default setting (1024)</dt>
    <dt>Choose an appropriate Periods/Buffer setting. If using a USB audio device, choose 3 for a more stable low latency setting, otherwise choose 2</dt>
    <dt>Click the OK button to apply the settings</dt>
        <dd>The "Setup - JACK Audio Connection Kit" window closes</dd>
    <dt>Click the Start button</dt>
        <dd>Jack eventually reports that it has "Started", and if the settings chosen were suitable, there should be no errors (xruns - which would be shown in red)</dd>
</dl>

This test confirms that Jack can keep two Studio applications in syncronisation.
<strong>Keep Qjackctl running (Started) after the previous test.

    <dt>Click on "Internal" button on Ardour's toolbar</dt>
        <dd>The button changes to "JACK" (meaning that JACK will now follow Ardour as timemaster)</dd>

        <dd>The "Preferences" window opens</dd>
    <dt>In the "Audio System" tab, choose JACK from the dropdown menu, click the OK button, and click OK again to restart Hydrogen</dt>
        <dd>Hydrogen restarts and two timemaster buttons show up on the Toolbar</dd>
    <dt>Make sure that J.TRANS (Jack Transport) is enabled</dt>
    <dt>Click the "Play" icon on the Hydrogen transport</dt>
        <dd>The Hydrogen transport begins to move, and the Ardour one moves in syncronisation</dd>
    <dt>Click the "Stop" button in Ardour</dt>
        <dd>Both the Hydrogen and Ardour transports stop moving</dd>
</dl>

This test confirms that Jack can patch different sources/instruments to Ardour (e.g. Hydrogen & Guitarix).
<strong>Keep Qjackctl, Ardour & Hydrogen running from the previous test.
