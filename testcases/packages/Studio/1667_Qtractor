This test will check if you can import a midi file and play it using a plugin instrument
<strong>For this test, you will need a midi file to import. If you do not have one, you can download one from the internet. For example, download "Prelude and Fugue in a minor (ca.  1708-14), BWV 894" from <a href="http://www.kunstderfuge.com/bach/harpsi.htm">http://www.kunstderfuge.com/bach/harpsi.htm</a>.
    A plug in is also required for this test. Ensure that a suitable soft-synth plugin is installed on the system. For example, install whysynth which can be used as a DSSI plugin in Qtractor.
    For this test, only one track is assigned an instrument to keep the test short.
