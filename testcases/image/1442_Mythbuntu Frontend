The testcase tests the installation and basic functionality of a Frontend. You will need a MythTV backend in the network to do this testcase completely.

<dl>
    <dt>Go though the Ubiquity install as you would any other install. Most options won't matter for this testcase, but be sure to choose the following options</dt>'
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li title="Specified Setting">Do NOT name the user mythtv</li>
                <li title="Specified Setting">Automatic (Guided) Partitioning</li>
                <li title="Specified Setting">"Frontend"</li>
                <li title="Specified Setting">If you have no remote, choose no remote suppport</li>
                <li title="Specified Setting">For the security key, enter the PIN from the backend (in the backend testcase, this is set to 1234)</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
    <dt>Once installation is finished, remove the installation media and reboot.</dt>
    <dt>Once the machine boots up, it should boot into the frontend.</dt>
    <dt>Select "Watch TV". (this will only work if you have a backend already in the network)</dt>
        <dd>The demo video should start playing.</dd>
